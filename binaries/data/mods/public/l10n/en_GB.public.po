"Brennus is the name which the Roman historians give to the famous leader of "

"Monmouth, the cleric who wrote “History of the Kings of Britain”, Brennus "
"and his brother Belinus invaded Gaul and sacked Rome in 390 B.C., 'proving' "
"that Britons had conquered Rome, the greatest civilization in the world, "
"long before Rome conquered the Britons. We know from many ancient sources "
"which predate Geoffrey that Rome was indeed sacked, but in 387 not 390, and "
"that the raid was led by a man named Brennos (which was latinized to "
"Brennus), but he and his invading horde were Gallic Senones, not British. In"
" this episode several features of Geoffrey's editing method can be seen: he "
"modified the historical Brennus/Brennos, created the brother Belinus, "
"borrowed the Gallic invasion, but omitted the parts where the Celts seemed "
"weak or foolish. His technique is both additive and subtractive. Like the "
"tale of Trojan origin, the story of the sack of Rome is not pure "
"fabrication; it is a creative rearrangement of the available facts, with "
"details added as necessary. By virtue of their historical association, Beli "
"and Bran are often muddled with the earlier brothers Belinus and Brennus "
"(the sons of Dunvallo Molmutius) who contended for power in northern Britain"
" in around 390 B.C., and were regarded as gods in old Celtic tradition."

"Cappadocia is a historical region in Central Anatolia. In the time of Herodotus, the Cappadocians were reported as occupying the whole region from Mount Taurus to the vicinity of the the Black Sea. Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in the south by the chain of the Taurus Mountains that separate it from Cilicia, to the east by the upper Euphrates and the Armenian Highland, to the north by Pontus, and to the west by Lycaonia and eastern Galatia. Cappadocia lies in eastern Anatolia. The relief consists of a high plateau over 1000 m in altitude that is pierced by volcanic peaks. Due to its inland location and high altitude, Cappadocia has a markedly continental climate, with hot dry summers and cold snowy winters. Rainfall is sparse and the region is largely semi-arid."
